Billy, this is Foster. For the love of Abaddon, man, don't go after it. Don't try to catch it or stop it- you
can't. Alright? Going outside to do anything in those woods right now would just be meshuga...just let
it do what it needs to do. Leave that tablesalt by your windows and entryways, and...hopefully it'll just
leave you alone. I've done all I can do for the people of this town, but they don't listen to reason. Or
men with ponytails. I'll keep you in my dark prayers. Shalom.
